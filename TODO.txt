-clean up(Rogier & Frank):
    -remove old environments not used anymore
    -remove minigridworld stuff
-implement function to calculate true Q values & plotting functionality for visualizing max bias (Pieter & Yun)

-for episode return and episode lengths fix xlabel from steps to episode(Pieter)
    -find a way to automatically (or manually) clip x-axis to where slowest algorithm converges to optimal performance (Pieter, make separate py file for reading in pickle)
-make config option that allows for not saving Q table data (Pieter)
-save average return per step plot (in main, Pieter)
-store all information for both vanilla and double
    -plots (and saves)
-policy plots if multiple argmaxes, plot all corresponding arrows
-hyperparameter tuning code:
    -how are we going to optimize alpha?
    -no gamma optimization
    -epsilon is useful to optimize as well (feasible? different for Vanilla and Double?)
    -suggestion: use number of steps to delta within optimality (+-0 episode return) as performance metric for hyperparameter optimization
-make hyperparameters algorithm specific

Discussion needed:
-think about what error bars represent (plot standard deviation?)

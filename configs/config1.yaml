#only for giving the names in the plot, not for selection of what to record during training
#the number of metric names determines how many of the first defined metrics are attempted to be plotted
#current metrics available: 
#1) episode_returns aggregates over seeds (mean,std)
#2) episode_lengths aggregates over seeds (mean,std)
